Native port of Rolling Curl for PHP

## About this project

**Warning:** This code is not fully working (that's why there are no tags :))

This was something I worked on while trying to scrape the Yahoo finance API. I was looking for a little performance boost. The code was mostly working, but I encountered sporadic segfaults at runtime.

I didn't have time to continue on this project, but it should be pretty close to working. Feel free to take it across the finish line. I think it would be really cool. I'll update the project w/ the userspace PHP code that I ported to zephir to help you along.
